## Getting Started with Knowledge Contributions

While skills are foundational or performative, knowledge is based more on answering questions that involve facts, data, or references.

Knowledge is supported by documents, such as a textbook, technical manual, encyclopedia, journal, or magazine.

Knowledge in the taxonomy tree consists of a few more elements than skills:

- Each knowledge node in the tree has a `qna.yaml`, similar to the format of the `qna.yaml` for skills.
- ‚≠ê Knowledge submissions require you to create a Git repository, which can be with GitHub, that contains the markdown files of your knowledge contributions. These contributions in your repository must use the markdown (`.md`) format.
- The `qna.yaml` includes parameters that contain information from your repository.

!!! tip
    Guidelines for Knowledge contributions

    - Submit the most up-to-date version of the document
    - All submissions must be text; images will be ignored
    - Do not use tables in your markdown freeform contribution

The `qna.yaml` format must include the following fields:

- `version`: The version of the `qna.yaml` file; this is the format of the file that is used for SDG. The value must be the number 3.
- `created_by`: Your GitHub username.
- `domain`: Specify the category of the knowledge.
- `seed_examples`: A collection of key/value entries.
  - `context`: A chunk of information from the knowledge document. Each `qna.yaml` needs five `context` blocks. The context has a maximum token count of 500 tokens. Also, each `context` blocks should have at least 3 question and answer pairs, with a maximum token count of 250 for all 3 question and answer pairs.
  - `questions_and_answers`: The parameter that holds your questions and answers.
    - `question`: Specify a question for the model. Each `qna.yaml` file needs at least three question and answer pairs per `context` chunk.
    - `answer`: Specify the desired answer from the model. Each `qna.yaml` file needs at least three question and answer pairs per `context` chunk.
- `document_outline`: Describe an overview of the document your submitting.
- `document`: The source of your knowledge contribution.
  - `repo`: The URL for your repository that holds your knowledge markdown files.
  - `commit`: The SHA of the commit in your repository with your knowledge markdown files.
  - `patterns`: A list of glob patterns that specify the markdown files in your repository. Any glob pattern that starts with `*`, such as `*.md`, must be quoted due to YAML rules. For example, `"*.md"`.

      **Phoenix** is a minor constellation in the southern sky. Named after the mythical
      phoenix, it was first depicted on a celestial atlas by Johann Bayer in his 1603
      *Uranometria*. The French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de
      Lacaille charted the brighter stars and gave their Bayer designations
      in 1756. The constellation stretches from roughly ‚àí39 degrees to ‚àí57 degrees
      declination, and from 23.5h to 2.5h of right ascension. The constellations Phoenix,
      Grus, Pavo, are known as the Southern Birds.

          declination, and from 23.5h to 2.5h of right ascension.
  - context: |
      Phoenix was the largest of the 12 constellations established by Petrus
      Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de
      Houtman. It first appeared on a 35cm diameter celestial globe published
      in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius. The first
      depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in Johann Bayer's
      *Uranometria* of 1603. De Houtman included it in his southern star catalog
      the same year under the Dutch name *Den voghel Fenicx*, "The Bird Phoenix",
      symbolising the phoenix of classical mythology. One name of the brightest star Alpha
      Phoenicis‚ÄîAnkaa‚Äîis derived from the Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿπŸÜŸÇÿßÿ°, romanized: al-‚ÄòanqƒÅ‚Äô,
      lit.‚Äâ'the phoenix', and was coined sometime after 1800 in relation to the constellation.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the brightest star in the Phoenix constellation
          called?
        answer: |
          Alpha Phoenicis or Ankaa is the brightest star in the Phoenix
          Constellation.
      - question: Where did the Phoenix constellation first appear?
        answer: |
          The Phoenix constellation first appeared on a 35-cm diameter
          celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by
          Plancius with Jodocus Hondius.
      - question: |
          What does "The Bird Phoenix" symbolize?
        answer: |
          "The Bird Phoenix" symbolizes the phoenix of classical mythology.
  - context: |
      Phoenix is a small constellation bordered by Fornax and Sculptor to the north,
      Grus to the west, Tucana to the south, touching on the corner of Hydrus to the
      south, and Eridanus to the east and southeast. The bright star Achernar is
      nearby. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the
      International Astronomical Union in 1922, is "Phe". The official constellation
      boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eug√®ne Delporte in 1930,
      are defined by a polygon of 10 segments. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right
      ascension coordinates of these borders lie between 23h 26.5m and 02h 25.0m,
      while the declination coordinates are between ‚àí39.31¬∞ and ‚àí57.84¬∞. This means it remains
      below the horizon to anyone living north of the 40th parallel in the Northern
      Hemisphere, and remains low in the sky for anyone living north of the equator.
      It is most visible from locations such as Australia and South Africa during
      late Southern Hemisphere spring. Most of the constellation lies within, and
      can be located by, forming a triangle of the bright stars Achernar, Fomalhaut
      and Beta Ceti‚ÄîAnkaa lies roughly in the centre of this.

### Knowledge: Markdown file example

The previous knowledge example references one markdown file: `phoenix_constellation.md`. You can also add multiple markdown files for knowledge contributions.

!!! note
    Due to the higher volume, **it will naturally take longer to receive acceptance for
    a knowledge contribution pull request than for a skill pull request**. Smaller
    pull requests are simpler and require less time and effort to review.

What might these markdown files look like? They can be freeform. Here's what a
snippet of `phoenix_constellation.md` might look like in your Git repository.

*Example of a `.md` file*

```markdown
# Phoenix (constellation)

**Phoenix** is a minor constellation in the southern sky. Named after the mythical
phoenix, it was first depicted on a celestial atlas by Johann Bayer in his 1603
*Uranometria*. The French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de
Lacaille charted the brighter stars and gave their Bayer designations
in 1756. The constellation stretches from roughly ‚àí39 degrees to ‚àí57 degrees
declination, and from 23.5h to 2.5h of right ascension. The constellations Phoenix,
Grus, Pavo, are known as the Southern Birds.

The brightest star, Alpha Phoenicis, is named Ankaa, an Arabic word meaning 'the Phoenix'.
It is an orange giant of apparent magnitude 2.4. Next is Beta Phoenicis, actually a
binary system composed of two yellow giants with a combined apparent magnitude of 3.3. Nu
Phoenicis has a dust disk, while the constellation has ten star systems with known planets and the recently
discovered galaxy clusters El Gordo and the Phoenix
Cluster‚Äîlocated 7.2 and 5.7 billion light years away respectively, two of the largest objects in the visible
universe. Phoenix is the radiant of two annual meteor showers: the Phoenicids in December, and the July
Phoenicids.

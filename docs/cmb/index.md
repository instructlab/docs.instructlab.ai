The primary goal of the InstructLab project is to democratize AI. One of the key ways our community seeks to do that is to enable collaborative contributions to improve an open source-licensed LLM based on the Granite models.

We are currently in a worldwide GPU shortage, and the InstructLab community project is actively pursuing hardware resources to enable regular builds of our collaborative community dataset into new versions of our model via industry and academic partnerships.

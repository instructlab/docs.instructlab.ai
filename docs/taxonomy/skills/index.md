## Getting Started with Skill Contributions

Skills require a much smaller volume of content than knowledge contributions. An entire skill contribution to the taxonomy tree can be just a few lines of YAML in the `qna.yaml` file ("qna" is short for "questions and answers") and an `attribution.txt` file for citing sources.

Your skills contribution pull requests must include the following:

- A `qna.yaml` that contains a set of key/value entries with the following keys
  - Each `qna.yaml` file requires a minimum of five question and answer pairs.
- An `attribution.txt` that includes the sources for the information used in the `qna.yaml`

!!! tip
    The skill taxonomy structure is used in several ways:

    1. To select the right subset of the taxonomy to use for data generation.
    2. To determine the interpretability by human contributors and maintainers.
    3. As part of the prompt to the LLM used to generate synthetic samples.


!!! important
    There is a limit to how much content can exist in the question/answer pairs for the model to process. Due to this, only add a maximum
    of around 2300 words to your question and answer seed example pairs in the `qna.yaml` file.

Compositional skills can either be grounded (includes a context) or ungrounded (does not include a context).  Grounded or ungrounded is declared in the taxonomy tree, for example: `linguistics/writing/poetry/haiku/` (ungrounded) or `grounded/linguistics/grammar` (grounded). The `qna.yaml` is in the final node.

Taxonomy skill files must be a valid [YAML](https://yaml.org/) file named `qna.yaml`. Each `qna.yaml` file contains a set of key/value entries with the following keys:

- `version`: The value must be the number 2. **Required**
- `task_description`: A description of the skill. **Required**
- `created_by`: The GitHub username of the contributor. **Required**
- `seed_examples`: A collection of key/value entries. New
  submissions should have at least five entries, although
  older files may have fewer. **Required**
  - `context`: Grounded skills require the user to provide context containing information that the model is expected to take into account during processing. This is different from knowledge, where the model is expected to gain facts and background knowledge from the tuning process. The context key should not be used for ungrounded skills.
  - `question`: A question for the model. **Required**
  - `answer`: The desired response from the model. **Required**

Other keys at any level are currently ignored.

### Skills: YAML examples

To make the `qna.yaml` files easier and faster for humans to read, it is recommended to specify `version` first, followed by `task_description`, then `created_by`, and finally `seed_examples`.
In `seed_examples`, it is recommended to specify `context` first (if applicable), followed by `question` and `answer`.

*Example `qna.yaml`*

```yaml
version: 2
task_description: <string>
created_by: <string>
seed_examples:
  - question: <string>
    answer: |
      <multi-line string>
  - context: |
      <multi-line string>
    question: <string>
    answer: |
      <multi-line string>
  ...
```

Then, you create an `attribution.txt` file that includes the sources of your information. These can also be self authored sources.

*Example `attribution.txt`*

```text
[Link to source]
[Link to work]
[License of the work]
[Creator name]
```

For more information on what to include in your `attribution.txt` file, see [For your attribution.txt file](https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#for-your-attributiontxt-file) in CONTRIBUTING.md.

If you have not written YAML before, don't be intimidated - it's just text.

!!! tip

    - Spaces and indentation matter in YAML. Two spaces to indent.
    - Don't use tabs!
    - Be careful to not have trailing spaces at the end of a line.
    - Each example in `seed_examples` begins with a "-". Place this "-" in
    front of the first field (`question` or `context`). The remaining keys in the
    example should not have this "-".
    - Some special characters such as " and ' need to be escaped with backslash. This is why some
    of the lines for keys in the example YAML start the value with the '|' character followed a new line and then an indented multi-line string.
    This character disables all of the special characters in the value for the key.
    You might also want to use the '|' character for multi-line strings.
    - Consider quoting all values with " to avoid surprising YAML parser behavior
    (e.g. Yes answer can be interpreted by the parser as a boolean of `True`
    value, unless "Yes" is quoted.)
    - See https://yaml-multiline.info/ for more info.

It is recommended that you **lint**, or verify, your YAML using a tool. One linter option is [yamllint.com](https://yamllint.com). You can copy/paste your YAML into the box and click **Go** to have it analyze your YAML and make recommendations. Online tools like [prettified](https://onlineyamltools.com/prettify-yaml) and [yaml-validator](https://jsonformatter.org/yaml-validator) can automatically reformat your YAML to adhere to our `yamllint` PR checks, such as breaking lines longer than 120 characters.

#### Ungrounded compositional skill: YAML example

```yaml
version: 2
task_description: 'Teach the model how to rhyme.'
created_by: juliadenham
seed_examples:
  - question: What are 5 words that rhyme with horn?
    answer: warn, torn, born, thorn, and corn.
  - question: What are 5 words that rhyme with cat?
    answer: bat, gnat, rat, vat, and mat.
  - question: What are 5 words that rhyme with poor?
    answer: door, shore, core, bore, and tore.
  - question: What are 5 words that rhyme with bank?
    answer: tank, rank, prank, sank, and drank.
  - question: What are 5 words that rhyme with bake?
    answer: wake, lake, steak, make, and quake.
```

Seriously, that's it.

Here is the location of this YAML in the taxonomy tree. Note that the YAML file
itself, plus any added directories that contain the file, is the entirety of the skill
in terms of a taxonomy contribution:

#### Grounded compositional skill: YAML example

Remember that [grounded compositional skills](skills_guide.md#grounded-compositional-skills) require additional context and include a `context` field.

This example snippet assumes the GitHub username `mairin` and shows some of the question/answer pairs present in the actual file:


```yaml
version: 2
task_description: |
    This skill provides the ability to read a markdown-formatted table.
created_by: mairin # Use your GitHub username; only one creator supported
seed_examples:
  - context: |
      | **Breed**      | **Size**     | **Barking** | **Energy** |
      |----------------|--------------|-------------|------------|
      | Afghan Hound   | 25-27 in     | 3/5         | 4/5        |
      | Labrador       | 22.5-24.5 in | 3/5         | 5/5        |
      | Cocker Spaniel | 14.5-15.5 in | 3/5         | 4/5        |
      | Poodle (Toy)   | <= 10 in     | 4/5         | 4/5        |

      Gr√°inne's letter is B and her color is red.
  - context: |
      | Banana | Apple      | Blueberry | Strawberry |

      | Peel   | Peel       | No peel   | No peel    |
    question: |
      Which fruit is blue, small, and has no peel?
    answer: |
      The blueberry is blue, small, and has no peel.
